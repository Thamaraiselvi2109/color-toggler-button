# 🎨 Color Button Toggler (React App)

This is a simple React application that renders five buttons. The background color of the buttons changes based on which one is clicked:

- Clicking an **odd-numbered** button turns all **odd buttons green** and **even buttons yellow**.
- Clicking an **even-numbered** button turns only that button **yellow**, while others stay **gray**.

## 🛠️ Features

- React functional components
- Conditional rendering based on button index
- `useState` hook for managing dynamic button colors
- Array mapping and logic separation for clean rendering
